# Project II

This repository contains all the necessary codes to perform a molecular dynamics simulation of a Xe gas at a given temperature starting from a disordered simple cubic structure. The simulation can be ran in serial or in parallel.

## 1. CONTAINS

1. `/SERIAL`: Directory containing all the necessary files and codes to perform the simulation in serial, along with the graphical representation of the evolution of some thermodynamical properties, the MSD and GDR. 
2. `/PARALLEL`: Directory containing all the necessary files and codes to perform the simulation in parallel (using MPI), along with the graphical representation of the evolution of some thermodynamical properties, the MSD and GDR.

## 3. NOTES

If some change may be made in any of the codes provided we would deeply aprecciate if the `CODE_FORMAT.txt`, which contains some general guidelines of the code format applied, is used as a guide to make it easier to contemplate the requested changes.
